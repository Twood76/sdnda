    <string name="ranger_introduction">
        Rough and wild looking,
        a human stalks alone
        through the shadows of
        trees, hunting the orcs he
        knows are planning a raid
        on a nearby farm. Clutching
        a shortsword in each hand,
        he becomes a whirlwind of
        steel, cutting down one enemy
        after another.

        \n\nAfter tumbling away from a cone of
        freezing air, an elf finds her feet and draws
        back her bow to loose an arrow at the white
        dragon. Shrugging off the wave of fear that emanates
        from the dragon like the cold of its breath, she sends
        one arrow after another to find the gaps between the
        dragon’s thick scales.

        \n\nHolding his hand high, a half-elf whistles to the hawk
        that circles high above him, calling the bird back to his
        side. Whispering instructions in Elvish, he points to
        the owlbear he’s been tracking and sends the hawk to
        distract the creature while he readies his bow.

        \n\nFar from the bustle of cities and towns, past the
        hedges that shelter the most distant farms from the
        terrors of the wild, amid the dense-packed trees of
        trackless forests and across wide and empty plains,
        rangers keep their unending watch.

    <string name="creating_renger_string">
        As you create your ranger character, consider the nature
        of the training that gave you your particular capabilities.
        Did you train with a single mentor, wandering the wilds
        together until you mastered the ranger’s ways? Did you
        leave your apprenticeship, or was your mentor slain—
        perhaps by the same kind of monster that became your
        favored enemy? Or perhaps you learned your skills as
        part of a band of rangers affiliated with a druidic circle,
        trained in mystic paths as well as wilderness lore. You
        might be self-taught, a recluse who learned combat
        skills, tracking, and even a magical connection to nature
        through the necessity of surviving in the wilds.

        \n\nWhat’s the source of your particular hatred of a
        certain kind of enemy? Did a monster kill someone
        you loved or destroy your home village? Or did you see
        too much of the destruction these monsters cause and
        com mit yourself to reining in their depredations? Is
        your adventuring career a continuation of your work
        in protecting the borderlands, or a significant change?

        \n\nWhat made you join up with a band of adventurers?
        Do you find it challenging to teach new allies the ways
        of the wild, or do you welcome the relief from solitude
        that they offer?
