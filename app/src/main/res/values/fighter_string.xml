    <string name="fighter_introduction">
        A human in clanging plate armor holds her shield
        before her as she runs toward the massed goblins. An
        elf behind her, clad in studded leather armor, peppers
        the goblins with arrows loosed from his exquisite
        bow. The half-orc nearby shouts orders, helping
        the two combatants coordinate their assault to the
        best advantage.

        \n\nA dwarf in chain mail interposes his shield between
        the ogre’s club and his companion, knocking the deadly
        blow aside. His companion, a half-elf in scale armor,
        swings two scimitars in a blinding whirl as she circles
        the ogre, looking for a blind spot in its defenses.

        \n\nA gladiator fights for sport in an arena, a master with
        his trident and net, skilled at toppling foes and moving
        them around for the crowd’s delight—and his own
        tactical advantage. His opponent’s sword flares with
        blue light an instant before she sends lightning flashing
        forth to smite him.

        \n\nAll of these heroes are fighters, perhaps the most
        diverse class of characters in the worlds of Dungeons and
        Dragons. Questing knights, conquering overlords, royal
        champions, elite foot soldiers, hardened mercenaries,
        and bandit kings — as fighters, they all share an
        unparalleled mastery with weapons and armor, and a
        thorough knowledge of the skills of combat. And they
        are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and
        staring it defiantly in the face.
    </string>

    <string name="creating_fighter_string">
        As you build your fighter, think about two related
        elements of your characters background: Where did
        you get your combat training, and what set you apart
        from the mundane warriors around you? Were you
        particularly ruthless? Did you get extra help from a
        mentor, perhaps because of your exceptional dedication?
        What drove you to this training in the first place? A
        threat to your homeland, a thirst for revenge, or a need
        to prove yourself might all have been factors.

        \n\nYou might have enjoyed formal training in an oble’s
        army or in a local militia. Perhaps you trained in a war
        academy, learning strategy, tactics, and military history.
        Or you might be self-taught—unpolished but well tested.
        Did you take up the sword as a way to escape the limits
        of life on a farm, or are you following a proud family
        tradition? Where did you acquire your weapons and
        armor? They might have been military issue or family
        heirlooms, or perhaps you scrimped and saved for years
        to buy them. Your armaments are now among your
        most important possessions—the only things that stand
        between you and death’s embrace.

        \nWhen you move, you can expend one superiority die, rolling the die and adding the number rolled to your AC until you stop moving.

        to maneuver one of your comrades into a more advantageous position.

        creature who can see or hear you. That creature can use its reaction to move up to
        half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks from the target of your attack.

        \n\n

        die to attempt to frighten the target. You add the superiority die to the attack’s

        is frightened of you until the end of your next turn.

        \n\n
        <b>Parry</b>
        \nW hen another creature damages you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction
        and expend one superiority die to reduce the damage by the number you roll on your
        superiority die + your Dexterity modifier.

        \n\n
        <b>Precision Attack</b>
        \nWhen you make a weapon attack roll against a creature, you can expend one superiority
        die to add it to the roll. You can use this maneuver before or after making the attack roll,
        but before any effects of the attack are applied.

        \n\n
        <b>Pushing Attack</b>
        \nW hen you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt
        to drive the target back. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and if the target
        is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you push the target up to
        15 feet away from you.

        \n\n
        <b>Rally</b>
        \nOn your turn, you can use a bonus action and expend one superiority die to bolster the resolve
        of one of your companions. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you.
        That creature gains temporary hit points equal to the superiority die roll + your Charisma modifier.

        \n\n
        <b>Riposte</b>
        \nWhen a creature m isses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority
        die to make a melee weapon attack against the creature. If you hit, you add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.

        \n\n
        <b>Sweeping Attack</b>
        \nW hen you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to damage another
        creature with the same attack. Choose another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within your reach.
        If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes damage equal to the number you roll on your
        superiority die. The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.

        \n\n
        <b>Trip Attack</b>
        \nWhen you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt
        to knock the target down. You add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll, and if the
        target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you knock the target prone.

    <string name="fighterEldritchKnightTitle">
        Eldritch Knight
    </string>
    <string name="fighterEldritchKnight">
        The archetypal Eldritch Knight com bines the martial mastery common to all fighters with a
        careful study of magic. Eldritch Knights use magical techniques similar
        to those practiced by wizards. They focus their study on two of the eight schools of magic: abjuration and evocation.
        Abjuration spells grant an Eldritch Knight additional protection in battle, and evocation spells deal damage to many foes
        at once, extending the fighter’s reach in combat.
        These knights learn a comparatively small number of spells, committing them to memory instead of keeping them in a spellbook.

        Weapon Bound
    </string>
    <string name="fighterEldritchKnightWeaponBound">
        At 3rd level, you learn a ritual that creates a magical bond between
        yourself and one weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour,
        which can be done during a short rest. The weapon must be within your reach throughout the ritual,
        at the conclusion of which you touch the weapon and forge the bond.

        \n\n
        Once you have bonded a weapon to yourself, you can’t be disarmed of that weapon unless you
        are incapacitated. If it is on the same plane of existence, you can summon that weapon as a
        bonus action on your turn, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand.

        \n\n
        You can have up to two bonded weapons, but can summon only one at a time with your bonus action.
         If you attempt to bond with a third weapon, you must break the bond with one of the other two.
