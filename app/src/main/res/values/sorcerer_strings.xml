        Golden eyes flashing, a human
        stretches out her hand and unleashes
        the dragonfire that burns in her veins.
        As an in ferno rages around her foes,
        leathery wings spread from her back and
        she takes to the air.

        \n\nLong hair whipped by a conjured wind,
        a half-elf spreads his arms wide and throws
        his head back. Lifting him momentarily off
        the ground, a wave of magic surges up in him,
        through him , and out from him in a mighty blast
        of lightning.

        \n\nCrouching behind a stalagmite, a halfling points a
        finger at a charging troglodyte. A blast of fire springs
        from her finger to strike the creature. She ducks back
        behind the rock formation with a grin, unaware that her
        wild magic has turned her skin bright blue.

        \n\nSorcerers carry a magical birthright conferred
        upon them by an exotic bloodline, some other worldly
        influence, or exposure to unknown cosmic forces.
        One can’t study sorcery as one learns a language, any
        more than one can learn to live a legendary life. No one
        chooses sorcery; the power chooses the sorcerer.

    <string name="create_sorcerer_string">
        The most important question to consider when creating
        your sorcerer is the origin of your power. As a starting
        character, you will choose an origin that ties to a draconic
        bloodline or the influence of wild magic, but the exact
        source of your power is up to you to decide. Is it a family
        curse, passed down to you from distant ancestors? Or
        did some extraordinary event leave you blessed with
        inherent magic but perhaps scarred as well?

        \n\nHow do you feel about the magical power coursing
        through you? Do you embrace it, try to master it, or
        revel in its unpredictable nature? Is it a blessing or
        a curse? Did you seek it out, or did it find you? Did
        you have the option to refuse it, and do you wish you
        had? What do you intend to do with it? Perhaps you
        feel like you’ve been given this power for some lofty
        purpose. Or you might decide that the power gives you
        the right to do what you want, to take what you want
        from those who lack such power. Perhaps your power
        links you to a powerful individual in the world — the fey
        creature that blessed you at birth, the dragon who put
        a drop of its blood into your veins, the lich who created
        you as an experiment, or the deity who chose you to
        carry this power.
