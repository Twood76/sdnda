        Signaling for her companions to wait, a halfling creeps
        forward through the dungeon hall. She presses an ear
        to the door, then pulls out a set of tools and picks the
        lock in the blink of an eye. Then she disappears into
        the shadows as her fighter friend moves forward to kick
        the door open.

        \n\nA human lurks in the shadows of an alley while his
        accomplice prepares for her part in the ambush. When
        their target — a notorious slaver — passes the alleyway,
        the accomplice cries out, the slaver comes to investigate,
        and the assassin’s blade cuts his throat before he can
        make a sound.

        \n\nSuppressing a giggle, a gnome waggles her fingers
        and magically lifts the key ring from the guard’s belt.
        In a moment, the keys are in her hand, the cell door is
        open, and she and her companions are free to make
        their escape.

        \n\nRogues rely on skill, stealth, and their foes’
        vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation.
        They have a knack for finding the solution to just about
        any problem , demonstrating a resourcefulness and
        versatility that is the cornerstone of any successful
        adventuring party.

    <string name="creating_rogue_string">
        As you create your rogue character, consider the
        character’s relationship to the law. Do you have a
        criminal past—or present? Are you on the run from the
        law or from an angry thieves’ guild master? Or did you
        leave your guild in search of bigger risks and bigger
        rewards? Is it greed that drives you in your adventures,
        or some other desire or ideal?

        \n\nWhat was the trigger that led you away from your
        previous life? Did a great con or heist gone terribly
        wrong cause you to reevaluate your career? Maybe
        you were lucky and a successful robbery gave you the
        coin you needed to escape the squalor of your life.
        Did wanderlust finally call you away from your home?
        Perhaps you suddenly found yourself cut off from your
        family or your mentor, and you had to find a new means
        of support. Or maybe you made a new friend—another
        member of your adventuring party — who showed you
        new possibilities for earning a living and employing
        your particular talents.
