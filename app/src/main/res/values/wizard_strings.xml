        Clad in the silver robes that denote her station, an
        elf closes her eyes to shut out the distractions of the
        battlefield and begins her quiet chant. Fingers weaving
        in front of her, she completes her spell and launches a
        tiny bead of fire toward the enemy ranks, where it erupts
        into a conflagration that engulfs the soldiers.

        \n\nChecking and rechecking his work, a human scribes
        an intricate magic circle in chalk on the bare stone
        floor, then sprinkles powdered iron along every line and
        graceful curve. When the circle is complete, he drones a
        long incantation. A hole opens in space inside the circle,
        bringing a whiff of brimstone from the otherworldly
        plane beyond.

        \n\nCrouching on the floor in a dungeon intersection, a
        gnome tosses a handful of sm all bones in scribed with
        mystic symbols, muttering a few words of power over
        them. Closing his eyes to see the visions more clearly,
        he nods slowly, then opens his eyes and points down the
        passage to his left.

        \n\nWizards are supreme magic-users, defined and united
        as a class by the spells they cast. Drawing on the subtle
        weave of magic that permeates the cosmos, wizards cast
        spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception,
        and brute-force mind control. Their magic conjures
        monsters from other planes of existence, glimpses the
        future, or turns slain foes into zombies. Their mightiest
        spells change one substance into another, call meteors
        down from the sky, or open portals to other worlds.

    <string name="creating_wizard_string">
        Creating a wizard character demands a backstory
        dominated by at least one extraordinary event. How
        did your character first come into contact with magic?
        How did you discover you had an aptitude for it? Do
        you have a natural talent, or did you simply study
        hard and practice incessantly? Did you encounter a
        magical creature or an ancient tome that taught you the
        basics of magic?

        \n\nWhat drew you forth from your life of study? Did your
        first taste of magical knowledge leave you hungry for
        more? Have you received word of a secret repository
        of knowledge not yet plundered by any other wizard?
        Perhaps youâ€™re simply eager to put your new found
        magical skills to the test in the face of danger.
