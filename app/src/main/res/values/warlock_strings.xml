        With a pseudodragon curled on his shoulder, a young
        elf in golden robes smiles warmly, weaving a magical
        charm into his honeyed words and bending the palace
        sentinel to his will.

        \n\nAs flames spring to life in her hands, a wizened
        human whispers the secret name of her demonic patron,
        infusing her spell with fiendish magic.

        \n\nShifting his gaze between a battered tome and the
        od dalignment of the stars overhead, a wild - eyed tiefling
        chants the mystic ritual that will open a doorway to a
        distant world.

        \n\nWarlocks are seekers of the knowledge that lies
        hidden in the fabric of the multiverse. Through pacts
        made with mysterious beings of supernatural power,
        warlocks unlock magical effects both subtle and
        spectacular. Drawing on the ancient know ledge of
        beings such as fey nobles, demons, devils, hags, and
        alien entities of the Far Realm, warlock s piece together
        arcane secrets to bolster their own power.

    <string name="creating_warlock_string">
        As you make your warlock character, spend some time
        thinking about your patron and the obligations that
        your pact imposes upon you. What led you to make the
        pact, and how did you make contact with your patron?
        Were you seduced into summoning a devil, or did you
        seek out the ritual that would allow you to make contact
        with an alien elder god? Did you search for your patron,
        or did your patron find and choose you? Do you chafe
        under the obligations of your pact or serve joyfully in
        anticipation of the rewards promised to you?

        \n\nWork with your DM to determine how big a part your
        pact will play in your character’s adventuring career.
        Your patron’s demands might drive you into adventures,
        or they might consist entirely of small favors you can do
        between adventures.

        \n\nWhat kind of relationship do you have with your
        patron? Is it friendly, antagonistic, uneasy, or romantic?
        How important does your patron consider you to be?
        What part do you play in your patron’s plans? Do you
        know other servants of your patron?

        \n\nHow does your patron communicate with you? If
        you have a familiar, it might occasionally speak with
        your patron’s voice. Some warlocks find messages
        from their patrons etched on trees, mingled among tea
        leaves, or adrift in the clouds — messages that only the
        warlock can see. Other warlocks converse with their
        patrons in dreams or waking visions, or deal only with
        intermediaries.
