    <string name="ChooseClassDescription">
        Class is the primary definition of what your character
        can do. It’s more than a profession; it’s your character’s
        calling. Class shapes the way you think about the
        world and interact with it and your relationship with
        other people and powers in the multiverse.
        \n\nA fighter,
        for example, might view the world in pragmatic terms
        of strategy and maneuvering, and see herself as just a
        pawn in a much larger game. A cleric, by contrast, might
        see himself as a willing servant in a god’s unfolding plan
        or a conflict brewing among various deities. While the
        fighter has contacts in a mercenary company or army,
        the cleric might know a num ber of priests, paladins, and
        devotees who share his faith.
