        If you are willing to start your adventure, you will need your avatar.
        \n\nThis application will do its best to navigate you through whole process of creating a DnD character. Try to read carefully all information about classes and races available in 5th edition of Dungeons and Dragons.
        \n\nBefore you dive into step 1, think about the
        kind of adventurer you want to play. You might be a
        courageous fighter, a skulking rogue, a fervent cleric, or
        a flamboyant wizard. Or you might be more interested
        in an unconventional character, such as a brawny rogue
        who likes hand-to-hand combat, or a sharpshooter who
        picks off en emies from afar. Do you like fantasy fiction
        featuring dwarves or elves? Try building a character of
        one of those races. Do you want your character to be the
        toughest adventurer at the table? Consider a class like
        barbarian or paladin. If you donâ€™t know where else to
        begin, take a look at the illustrations to see
        what catch es your interest.
