        Her fists a blur as they deflect an incoming hail of arrows,
        a half-elf springs over a barricade and throws herself
        into the massed ranks of hobgoblins on the other side.
        She whirls among them, knocking their blows aside and
        sending them reeling, until at last she stands alone.

        \n\nTaking a deep breath, a human covered in tattoos
        settles into a battle stance. As the first charging orcs
        reach him, he exhales and a blast of fire roars from his
        mouth, engulfing his foes.
        \n\nMoving with the silence of the night, a black-clad
        halfling steps into a shadow beneath an arch and
        emerges from another inky shadow on a balcony a
        stone’s throw away. She slides her blade free of its cloth-
        wrapped scabbard and peers through the open window
        at the tyrant prince, so vulnerable in the grip of sleep.

        \n\nWhatever their discipline, monks are united in their
        ability to magically harness the energy that flows in
        their bodies. Whether channeled as a striking display
        of combat prowess or a subtler focus of defensive ability
        and speed, this energy infuses all that a monk does.

        As you make your monk character, think about your
        connection to the monastery where you learned your
        skills and spent your formative years. Were you an
        orphan or a child left on the monastery’s threshold? Did
        your parents promise you to the monastery in gratitude
        for aservice perform ed by the monks? Did you enter
        this secluded life to hide from a crime you committed?
        Or did you choose the monastic life for yourself?

        \n\nConsider why you left. Did the head of your monastery
        choose you for a particularly important mission beyond
        the cloister? Perhaps you were cast out because of
        some violation of the community’s rules. Did you dread
        leaving, or were you happy to go? Is there something
        you hope to accomplish outside the monastery? Are you
        eager to return to your home?

        \n\nAs a result of the structured life of a monastic
        community and the discipline required to harness ki,
        monks are almost always lawful in alignment.
