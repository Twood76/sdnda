        A tall human tribesman strides through a blizzard, draped in fur and hefting his axe. He laughs as he charges toward the frost giant who dared poach his people’s elk herd.
        \n\nFor some, their rage springs from a communion with fierce animal spirits. Others draw from a roiling reservoir of anger at a world full of pain. For every barbarian, rage is a power that fuels not just a battle frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and feats of strength.
    </string>

    <string name="creating_barbarian_string">
        When creating a barbarian character, think about where your character com es from and his or her place in the world. Talk with your DM about an appropriate origin for your barbarian. Did you com e from a distant land, making you a stranger in the area of the campaign? Or is the campaign set in a rough-and-tumble frontier where barbarians are common? What led you to take up the adventuring life? Were you lured to settled lands by the promise of riches? Did you join forces with soldiers of those lands to face a shared threat? Did monsters or an invading horde drive you out of your homeland, making you a rootless refugee? Perhaps you were a prisoner of war, brought in chains to “civilized” lands and only now able to win your freedom. Or you might have been cast out from your people because of a crime you committed, a taboo you violated, or a coup that removed you from a position of authority.

    <string name="barbarianPrimalPath">
        At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of
        your rage. Choose the Path of the Berserker or the Path
        of the Totem Warrior. Your choice grants you features at 3rd
        level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.
    </string>

    <string name="barbarianPathOfBerserker">
        For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end - that
        end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path
        of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter
        the berserker’s rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle,
        heed less of your own health or well-being.
    </string>

    <string name="barbarianTotemWarrior">
        The Path of the Totem Warrior is a spiritual journey, as
        the barbarian accepts a spirit animal as guide, protector,
        and inspiration. In battle, your totem spirit fills you
        with supernatural might, adding magical fuel to your
        barbarian rage.
        \n\nMost barbarian tribes consider a totem animal to be
        kin to a particular clan. In such cases, it is unusual for
        an individual to have more than one totem animal spirit,
        though exceptions exist.
    </string>

    <string name="barbarianUnarmoredDefense">
        While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class
        equals <b>10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution
        modifier</b>.
        \n\nYou can use a shield and still gain this benefit.
    </string>

    <string name="barbarianRage">
        In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn,
        you can enter a rage as a bonus action.
        While raging, you gain the following benefits if you
        aren’t wearing heavy armor:
        \n\n• You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength
        saving throws.
        \n\n• When you make a melee weapon attack using
        Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that
        increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown
        in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.
        \n\n• You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and
        slashing damage.
        \n\nIf you are able to cast spells, you can’t cast them or
        concentrate on them while raging.
        \n\nYour rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are
        knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you
        haven’t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn
        or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage
        on your turn as a bonus action.
        \n\nOnce you have raged the number of times shown
        for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the
        Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you
        can rage again.
    </string>

    <string name="barbarianRecklessAttack">
        Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern
        for defense to attack with fierce desperation.
        \n\nWhen
        you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide
        to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on
        melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this
        turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until
        your next turn.
    </string>

    <string name="barbarianDangerSense">
        At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things
        nearby aren’t as they should be, giving you an edge
        when you dodge away from danger.
        \n\nYou have advantage on Dexterity saving throws
        against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells.
        To gain this benefit, you can’t be blinded, deafened, or
        incapacitated.
    </string>

    <string name="barbarianBerserkerFrenzy">
        Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you
        can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for
        the duration of your rage you can make a single melee
        weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns
        after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level
        of exhaustion.
    </string>

    <string name="barbarianBerserkerMindlessRage">
        Beginning at 6th level, you can’t be charmed or
        frightened while raging. If you are charmed or
        frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is
        suspended for the duration of the rage.
    </string>

    <string name="barbarianBerserkerIntimidatingPresence">
        Beginning at 10th level, you can use your action to
        frighten someone with your menacing presence.
        When you do so, choose one creature that you can see
        within 30 feet of you.
        \nIf the creature can see or hear
        you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC
        equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma
        modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your
        next turn.
        \nOn subsequent turns, you can use your action
        to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened
        creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends
        if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more
        than 60 feet away from you.
        \nIf the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can't
        use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours.
    </string>

        Starting at 14th level, when you take damage from

    </string>

    <string name="barbarianSpiritSeeker">
        Yours is a path that seeks attunement with the natural
        world, giving you a kinship with beasts. At 3rd level when
        you adopt this path, you gain the ability to cast the beast
        sense and speak with animals spells, but only as rituals,
        as described in chapter 10.
    </string>

    <string name="barbarianTotemSpirit">
        At 3rd level, w hen you adopt this path, you choose a
        totem spirit and gain its feature. You must make or
        acquire a physical totem object - an amulet or similar
        adornment — that in corporates fur or feathers, claws,
        teeth, or bones of the totem animal. At your option, you
        also gain minor physical attributes that are reminiscent
        of your totem spirit. For example, if you have a bear
        totem spirit, you might be unusually hairy and thick-
        skinned, or if your totem is the eagle, your eyes turn
        bright yellow.
        \n\nYour totem animal might be an animal related to those
        listed here but more appropriate to your homeland.
        /nFor exam ple, you could choose a hawk or vulture in
        place of an eagle.
        \n\n<b>Bear:</b> While raging, you have resistance to all damage
        except psychic damage. The spirit of the bear makes you
        tough enough to stand up to any punishment.

        heavy armor, other creatures have disadvantage on

        of the eagle makes you into a predator who can weave
        through the fray with ease.
        \n\n<b>Wolf:</b> While you’re raging, your friends have
        advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature
        within 5 feet of you that is hostile to you. The spirit of
        the wolf makes you a leader of hunters.
    </string>

    <string name="barbarianTotemicAtunement">

        totem animal of your choice. You can choose the same
        animal you selected previously or a different one.
        \n\n<b>Bear:</b> While you’re raging, any creature within 5 feet
        of you that’s hostile to you has disadvantage on attack
        rolls against targets other than you or another character
        with this feature. An enemy is immune to this effect if it
        can’t see or hear you or if it can’t be frightened.
        \n\n<b>Eagle:</b> While raging, you have a flying speed equal to
        your current walking speed. This benefit work s only in
        short bursts; you fall if you end your turn in the air and
        nothing else is holding you aloft.
        \n\n<b>Wolf:</b> While you're raging, you can use a bonus action
        on your turn to knock a Large or smaller creature prone

        Beginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional
        weapon damage die when determining the extra
        damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.
        \n\nThis increases to two additional dice at 13th level
        and three additional dice at 17th level.

    </string>

    <string name="barbarianRelentlessRage">
        Starting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting
        despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points
        while you’re raging and don’t die outright, you can make
        a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed , you
        drop to 1 hit point instead.
        \n\nEach time you use this feature after the first, the DC

        DC resets to 10.
    </string>

    <string name="barbarianPersistentRage">
